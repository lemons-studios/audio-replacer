# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
I am one guy who develops this app for a very specific use case on some of his spare time. If a security vulnerability arises from this package (unlikely) or any of the dependencies it uses (more likely), I will do my best to rectify the issue within a reasonable amount of time

### Windows
Issues that only affect Windows 10 will not be patched, though I don't think issues that only affect Windows 10 will be discovered anytime soon. 

### Linux
Same thing as Windows, Except it's for latest LTS and latest stable release for the kernel

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability in Audio Replacer that may cause issues, please reach out via [Email](mailto:andrewpinter23@gmail.com). If there is a vulnerability with a project dependency, rest assured that I am probably working on updating Audio Replacer to use versions of the affected dependency that aren't affected by the vulnerability
