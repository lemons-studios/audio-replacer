# Contributing To Audio Replacer
This is a solo project, so if you are a developer and spot issues or features missing and want to improve the quality of the app, please feel free to do so!

Here are some general guidelines for your changes and pull requests:

- Make sure you have tested the addition before submitting a pull request (Test on both Windows **AND** Linux before making a pull request)
- The pull request shouldn't contain any (intentionally) malicious code
- Use the latest versions of NodeJS and Rust that are available at the time of when you are making your changes
- Do not add, update, or remove any packages unless it you must do so to work on your fix/feature
- Try not to remove any features unless:
    1. Your feature addition make the feature obsolete
    2. The pull request is focused solely on making the feature obsolete
