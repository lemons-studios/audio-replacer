## ❓ About
Audio Replacer is a tool designed to streamline dubbing over video game voice-overs (or any set of audio files). Originally developed for a future project of mine, but can work for any use case!

### ✅ Use cases:
- Voice-Over translation mods
- Have your friend(s) dub over a video game you all love (This is what audio replacer was created for)

### ❌ What this app CANNOT do:
- Automatically replace content with AI (That's nasty by the way, don't even think about doing this)
- Rip video game asset files

## 🖥️ Features

- Create custom pitch/effect files, powered by FFMpeg
- Built-in custom data editor
- Support for Discord Rich presence
- Support for speech-to-text transcription with Whisper
- Noise suppression supported with RNNNoise
- Automatic app updates (Windows Only)
- Hotkeys for common tasks
